Suppose we are interested in the factors that influence whether a political candidate wins an election. 
The outcome (response) variable is binary (0/1); win or lose. 
The predictor variables of interest are the amount of money spent on the campaign, 
the amount of time spent campaigning negatively and whether or not the candidate is an incumbent.
